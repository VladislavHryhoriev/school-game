This includes both the events with the head of the hooligans, the hooligan community at the abandoned factory in general, and the events with the girl with the strange glasses.
			— Fixed some bugs and bugs related to the course of story quests given by story NPS. Now the conditions for obtaining certain quests are more intuitive, and their passage itself takes less time from the player due to the smaller number of delays between them.

			— A new perk for levels has been added: overpowering. With his help recovery time from poisoning and fights will be reduced by half.
			— New cheats have been added: entering the phrase limbs in the Patreon code input menu will heal all limbs of your character, entering the phrase occult will add 10.000 credits to the occult club budget, and entering the phrase change will add relationship points with the selected randomized NPS.

			— Added a new character trait for randomized female NPS - looks addict. It manifests with low romanticism and high level of love for the cute, and the effect is a greater impact of the appearance of your character on the available modifiers.
